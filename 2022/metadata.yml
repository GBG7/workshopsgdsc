  host:
  - Riddhesh Shah
  description: First of a series of machine learning workshops. Introduction to basic
    machine learning concepts and a non-math approach to Machine Learning. Build your
    first machine model using a Kaggle dataset!  We will be covering basic concepts
    such as decision trees/forests, overfitting/underfitting, building the intuition
    behind how gradients are used for learning algorithms and hyper parameter tuning
    to help your model hit that sweet spot.  We will be using guided Kaggle labs for
    the workshop and help you move closer to getting your first Kaggle certification!
    All you need is some basic python knowledge and a laptop.
